            <p>Boxing is a complex sport with a simple premise: Beat the other man up and either hit him more effectively to win on a point system, or hit him so hard or so much that he can't continue to fight.

                This is the simple premise.  Boxing beyond the premise is very complicated and filled with conflicts that define what it means to be a boxer.
                
                Money is an example of a complicated issue within boxing. On one hand, we don't want boxers to starve and go broke despite bringing so much to the sport (ex: Sugar Ray Robinson, Joe Louis).
                
                At the same time, boxers tend to take advantage of the fact that they make more money now for doing so much less. This leads to boring fights, useless fights and sometimes for long periods of time, no fights.
                
                What a great quote does is illuminate the truths or issues within boxing, no matter if they are financial, structural, cultural or whatever. Boxing quotes can be funny, sad, angry or perplexing about numerous topics that plague or uplift the sport.
                
                Boxing quotes can also come from all types of sources, from ringside announcers and analysts to boxing managers and trainers to the very boxers themselves that define the sport.
                
                Most of these quotes will come from legendary boxers. Sometimes, no one can tell the truth about the "sweet science" like a long-time warrior of the sport.
                
                Now I'm sure you've been well-broken in, the time has come to reveal the "50 Greatest Boxing Quotes of All Time."</p>
